A CSV file containing table data is loaded and transferred to a data frame using the Pandas library. The data frame is copied into a variable called "df".

The first five observations of the data set are obtained using "df.head()", the last five observations using "df.tail()", general information about the data set using "df.info()", and basic statistics of numerical variables using "df.describe().T()". The existence of missing data in the data set is checked using "df.isnull().values.any()", and the number of missing data is calculated using "df.isnull().sum()".

Several visualization operations are performed on the data set. "df['PriceRange'].value_counts().plot.barh()" is used to show the number of classes of a categorical variable as a bar graph. Histograms are plotted for all numerical variables using "df.hist(figsize=(20,15))".

The "PriceRange" variable is defined as a sortable categorical variable and re-categorized in the data set. Then, using the "sns.pointplot()" and "sns.catplot()" functions, how the averages of variables change according to different price ranges is shown.

Since some columns in the data set are categorical, the "pd.get_dummies()" function is used to convert them into numerical columns. Also, the "Color" column is converted to numerical values. After these operations, linear regression and multiple linear regression models are created on the data set.

Finally, the data set is divided into training and test sets, and a linear regression model is created using the "LinearRegression()" class. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as "cross_val_score()", "cross_val_predict()", and "mean_squared_error()".
